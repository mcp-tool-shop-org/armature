"""Every `pytest.raises` on a class that carries more than one refusal names its clause.

Wave 6, F-0d6fa12a. 34 sites in this suite wrapped a refusal in a bare
`pytest.raises(ArmatureError)` / `GateFailure` / `PayloadError` with no `match=`, no
`str(exc.value)` assertion and no evidence check, so ANY refusal raised anywhere inside the
call satisfied them. `tests/test_make_plate.py` was the representative case: three inputs
(no `--why`, `--why=`, `--why=   `) each under a bare raise, where a size gate, an anchor
gate or a source gate firing first would have passed all three under the name "no reason".

The class was measured decisively on the compensator pair (F-c0f49504): replacing the whole
`.armature_run` ownership clause in `stage_render.delete_output_dir` with an unrelated
`ArmatureError` left both of its tests green. Measured again there, on two more members of
the family: substituting `make_plate`'s `--why` refusal and `aapose.hand_stickwidth`'s
unknown-profile refusal with unrelated `ArmatureError`s turns
`test_a_plate_with_no_reason_never_gets_written` and
`test_unknown_stickwidth_type_raises_rather_than_falling_through` red, where the bare form
accepted both substitutions.

Wave 8, F-6e1c1dd6 — why the population is now DERIVED. Until this wave the census policed
three TYPED names (`ArmatureError`, `GateFailure`, `PayloadError`) and its premise test
asked the wrong question: whether a name is a BASE class in `errors.py`. Being a base is not
the property that makes a bare `pytest.raises` weak. The property is how many DISTINCT
refusals one class carries: if a class is raised from exactly one site, its name IS its
clause; from 45 sites it names nothing. Measured on the tree: `RouteGate` is raised from 45
distinct sites across `route_gates.py`, `gate_saved_graph.py`, `build_t2v_payload.py` and
`build_r2v_payload.py`, and this suite carried 21 clauseless `pytest.raises(RouteGate)`
sites that the typed census could not see. Measured decisively: with a plugin leaving
`route_gates.is_api_format` and `route_gates.gate_s_registration` raising `RouteGate` but
substituting an unrelated CLAUSE, `test_route_gates.py::test_is_api_format_refuses_an_...`
and `::test_a_graph_with_no_seed_at_all_is_indeterminate_...` both passed.

THE DERIVATION (wave 8's rule — a census may not type its own population):

  population = every class DEFINED by a `class` statement anywhere under `tools/`
               (`tools/superseded/` excluded — it is the failure museum, not the pipeline)
               that is RAISED from MORE THAN ONE distinct `(file, line)` under `tools/`.

Both halves come from one `ast.walk` of every module in the tree: `ClassDef` names for the
first, `Raise` nodes for the second. Nothing is typed but the recorded answer the derivation
is asserted against, which is what makes a new member fail loudly here on the day it lands.
`FramingError` and `WalkError` were the proof that the old premise was the wrong one: on
the wave-10 base both derived from `ValueError`, not `ArmatureError`, so a class-hierarchy
walk rooted at the repo root class would still have missed 11 clauseless sites. (Wave 10
rebased them, and `glb.MalformedGLB`, onto `ArmatureError` — see
`test_two_policed_classes_do_not_descend_from_the_repo_root_error`. The derivation did not
have to change, which is the point: it never depended on the hierarchy.)

The bar is deliberately zero: a leaf class exists for most of these refusals, and where it
does not, the message is what the refusal is named for.

#: `BindingSheetGate` (1) and `PartsSheetGate` (1) are deliberately absent, and join the
#: day a second raise site does;
#: `MalformedGLB` arrives with core-solvers' (13 sites in `glb.py` after wave 10 —
#: `read_chunks` and `_image_blob`). It subclassed `ValueError` on the wave-10 base, which
#: is why the predicate is "defined under tools/ and raised from more than one site" and

#: it did not see `FramingError` and `WalkError`. Wave 10 rebased all three; the predicate
#: is unchanged, because it never keyed on the hierarchy.

#: joins the day a second one is written. Core-solvers' `NonReiterableFrames` is deliberately
#: absent — one raise site, so the class IS its clause. `CropStripError` arrives with
#: instruments-measure's (7 sites in `make_crop_strip.py`, whose refusals were `SystemExit`
#: on this branch). `RenderTurnaroundGate` is unaffected by being
#: re-based on `GateFailure` in the same amend: the derivation keys on the class NAME and
